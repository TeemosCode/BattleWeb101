Some data are already provided.

When a user confirms his signup through the email verification link, their data would be saved into the Player table of the database and have the fields populated.

It has not been tested yet. But I have added in a scheduling package - Django-extensions and have the script to renew the whole database everyday under the 'daily' directory.
It's a script that sends a GET signal to the RenewEverydayData View class in Django.
REFER TO:
# https://django-extensions.readthedocs.io/en/latest/jobs_scheduling.html#setup
# https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/get-post-requests-using-python/

It has been tested that the View does exactly what it's suppose to do. As for the package, I am not so sure about it yet.

But following through its documentation, nee to run the following in the command line:

# 1. Activate virtual env -> conda.
2. The command line
# source activate /anaconda3/envs/IS590WFO_final_project
# python manage.py runjob renew_grid_player_data

@@@!!IMPORTANT
---REMBMER TO RUN THIS FIRST or to manually make a request to the View URL which is "daily_update/" to Prepopulate the data first (In the Grid table for every player)!!!!---
@@@@@@


P.S (Django Schedule was supposed to be used first, had it set up and configured and everything. But was stuck on the redis server part. So instead went for the Django-extensions package)
